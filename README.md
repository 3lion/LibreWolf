## Browser Files
This folder contains platform specific subfolders which houses the scripts and files required to compile LibreWolf on various platforms such as Linux, Windows, Mac and android.
All of the platforms are self explanatory with the exception of common. Common stores files common to all platforms, mainly our custom branding to be applied to the source code.
